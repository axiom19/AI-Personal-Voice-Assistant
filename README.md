# AI-Personal-Voice-Assistant

An interactive voice assistant powered by OpenAI's GPT model, with speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities, designed for seamless voice-based interactions.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the creation of a sophisticated voice assistant that leverages OpenAI's GPT-3 model and speech processing technologies. The assistant can:

- Accept voice input from users
- Convert speech to text for processing
- Send text queries to OpenAI's GPT-3 model
- Receive and process AI-generated responses
- Convert text responses back to speech
- Play audio responses to the user

The result is a fully functional virtual assistant capable of understanding and responding to a wide range of user queries and commands through natural language interaction.

## Features

- Natural language processing using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model
- Speech-to-text functionality for voice input
- Text-to-speech capability for audio responses
- Customizable voice options for assistant responses
- Light/dark mode toggle for user interface
- Responsive web-based interface

## Tech Stack

- Backend: Python (Flask)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- AI: OpenAI API
- Speech Processing: Speech-to-text and text-to-speech libraries
